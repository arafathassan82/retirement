## Database Setup
1. Make a database called **retirement**. *(You may have to change the username or password settings in db.php to allow the program to access your database)*
2. run `php create_tables.php` in terminal.
3. run `php insert_data.php` to fill the database in with sample data. Alternatively, you may fill the database with your own data.
